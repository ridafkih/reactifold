## Reactifold

### Reactifold only supports the following file structure for React components. 
├── ...
├── componentName
│   ├── componentName.tsx
│   └── componentName.module.css
└── ...

I found myself repeatedly configuring React components, just for them to all have the same structure. 
This will save me about 30 seconds per React component, which will speed up the development process for larger projects. 

Feel free to fork this, or make your own contributions if you want to add configurations, templates, or whatever have you.
